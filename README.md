What is OTA Programming?
OTA Programming (Over the Air) is a process which allows devices to upgrade their firmware or software wirelessly without any physical access. It uses wireless technology like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS or 4G/3G rather than wired serial communication. OTA is used to reprogram the devices like microcontrollers, cellphones, computers, set-top box etc. OTA updates are generally sent for updating the software, resolving the bugs, adding some features etc. With the increasing use of IoT devices OTA is transferred using frequency bands having low data transmission rate (868 MHz, 900 MHz, 2400 MHz).
